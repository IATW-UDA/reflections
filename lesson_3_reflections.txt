Q1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1.a)If multiple people are working on the same project. b)If you use multiple devices to access and work on the project. c)If backup or security is a concern.
Q2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2.If other users are working on the project, you might want to manually update to avoid confusing your changes with theirs.
Q3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3.A fork creates a copy of a repository on a server, typically GitHub. A clone is a copy from one server (GitHub, perhaps) to another server location. A branch is a part of a repository that contains changes not on the master version.
A fork would be used to create a repository for a new project while keeping the original intact. A clone is used to pull a repository to a local machine. A branch is used to make changes within a repository that may be incorporated into the master at a later time.
